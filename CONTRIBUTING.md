## Prerequisites

- Git

## Local development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bosun-sh/ohtools.git
cd ohtools

bun run ci:premerge   # lint + build + test — must be green before you open a PR
```

## Running tests

```bash
bun test              # full suite
bun run ci:lint       # linting + type-check only
bun run ci:build      # build only
```

## Before submitting a pull request

Run the full gate and confirm it is green:

```bash

```

If the gate is red, fix the errors before opening the PR.
